Python Programming Language

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax
and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has
become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write
clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Key features of Python include:
- Dynamic typing
- Automatic memory management (garbage collection)
- Large standard library
- Support for multiple programming paradigms
- Easy to learn and use
- Extensive ecosystem of packages (PyPI)
- Interactive interpreter (REPL)

Python is widely used in:
- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data science and machine learning (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow)
- Scientific computing
- Automation and scripting
- Artificial intelligence

Major companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and Spotify use Python extensively
in their technology stacks.
