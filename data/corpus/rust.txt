Rust Programming Language

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.
It accomplishes these goals without having a garbage collector, making it a useful
language for a number of use cases other languages aren't good at: embedding in
other languages, programs with specific space and time requirements, and writing
low-level code, like device drivers and operating systems.

Rust's rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety
at compile-time. This allows you to eliminate many classes of bugs before your code
even runs.

Key features of Rust include:
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Move semantics
- Guaranteed memory safety
- Threads without data races
- Trait-based generics
- Pattern matching
- Type inference
- Minimal runtime
- Efficient C bindings

Rust is used by companies like Mozilla, Dropbox, Cloudflare, and Discord for building
reliable and efficient software. The language continues to grow in popularity for
systems programming, web assembly, and embedded development.
